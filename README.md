# The leftovers

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Design any remaining components needed for your website—including components for other pages (pages that we’re not actually coding).
- *When we start doing the homepage next week there should be nothing left to style—you should be able to assemble the whole page with all your created patterns.*
  - Make sure each pattern is a unique, single element—we’re not going to write their code again, or even copy-and-paste it, we’re going to use a system to pull it into our pages. The only exception to this rule is the buttons, the HTML for buttons is so simple we will copy-and-paste those.
- *When you hand off your pattern library to your “developer” there should be no components missing.*
- **Also, go through every single pattern and make sure nothing is styled by tag—only by class.**
- **Double check the README explanations:**
  - Are all your explanations for the patterns good enough?
  - Could another person in class jump in and code a whole page on the site without asking you questions?
  - Could a developer take your pattern library and build the whole website from it without asking questions?
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Task list

- [ ] Create any remaining patterns—everything should be done.
- [ ] Make sure each pattern is a unique single element.
- [ ] Make sure there is no CSS targeting an HTML tag, like `a` or `html` inside every pattern CSS file.
- [ ] Make sure each pattern has appropriate accessibility features: ARIA landmark roles, skip links, alt attributes, etc.
- [ ] Double check the README explanations, they should be descriptive enough for someone else in class.
- [ ] Drag the `common` folder into Markbot and fix all the errors.
- [ ] Drag the each individual pattern folder into Markbot and fix all the errors.
