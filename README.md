# The leftovers

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `dog-rescue-pattern-library`*
- Design any remaining components needed for your website.
- *When we start doing the homepage next week there should be nothing left to style—you should be able to copy-and-paste and assemble the whole page with all your created patterns.*
- **Also, go through every single pattern and make sure nothing is styled by tag—only by class.**
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*

## Details

- *When & why:* In the `README.md` files describe when to use each new pattern you create.
