# The leftovers

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Design any remaining components needed for your website—including components for other pages (pages that we’re not actually coding).
- *When we start doing the homepage next week there should be nothing left to style—you should be able to copy-and-paste and assemble the whole page with all your created patterns.*
- *When you hand off your pattern library to your “developer” there should be no components missing.*
- **Also, go through every single pattern and make sure nothing is styled by tag—only by class.**
- **Double check the README explanations:**
  - Are all your explanations for the patterns good enough?
  - Could another person in class jump in and code a whole page on the site without asking you questions?
  - Could a developer take your pattern library and build the whole website from it without asking questions?
- *Run your pattern library through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.*
